## Task: ReactJS Learning Project

## Objective:

The objective of this task is to provide a learning opportunity for fresh graduates to gain proficiency in ReactJS. The task includes revising core React concepts, exploring advanced topics, and completing a small project to demonstrate their skills.

## Instructions:

1. Core ReactJS Revision:
    - Review the fundamental concepts of ReactJS, including components, JSX syntax, props, state, and lifecycle methods.
    - Understand the Virtual DOM and how React efficiently updates the user interface.
    - Practice building simple React components and rendering them to the DOM.
    - Explore component composition and the concept of reusability in React.
2. Advanced ReactJS Topics:
    - Dive deeper into React by studying more advanced concepts, such as React Hooks, context API, and error boundaries.
    - Learn about React Router for handling client-side routing in React applications.
    - Study state management libraries like Redux or MobX, and their integration with React.
    - Experiment with React testing frameworks like Jest and Enzyme for writing unit tests for your React components.
3. ReactJS Project:
    - Design and develop a small web application using ReactJS that showcases your skills.
    - Choose a project idea that allows you to demonstrate your understanding of React components, state management, and React ecosystem tools.
    - Use modern React features and best practices in your project.
    - Implement responsive design using CSS or CSS-in-JS libraries.
    - Test your React components to ensure their functionality and reliability.
