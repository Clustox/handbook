# Learn Ruby on Rails

## Objective:

To gain a thorough understanding of Ruby on Rails concepts and demonstrate proficiency through the development of a basic Rails application.

## Steps:

1. Study the official Rails documentation:
    - Visit the official Rails documentation at **https://guides.rubyonrails.org/**.
    - Go through the guides provided to understand the core concepts, principles, and features of Ruby on Rails.
    - Take notes and ensure you comprehend the fundamental concepts discussed.
2. Learn basic Rails concepts and workflow:
    - Familiarize yourself with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern used in Rails.
    - Understand the routing system and how requests are handled.
    - Learn about ActiveRecord and database migrations for managing data.
    - Explore the asset pipeline for managing CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.
    - Get acquainted with the testing framework (e.g., using MiniTest or RSpec) for ensuring code quality.
3. Utilize online resources:
    - Watch the recommended YouTube course at **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg**.
    - Search for additional tutorials, articles, and blog posts that provide explanations, examples, and best practices for Rails development.
    - Take advantage of interactive platforms, such as Codecademy or Udemy, if necessary.
4. Develop a sample project proposal:
    - Brainstorm ideas for a basic Rails application that incorporates the concepts you've learned.
    - Prepare a project proposal outlining the purpose, features, and expected outcome of your application.
    - Submit the proposal to your mentor for approval and feedback.
    - Revise the proposal as per the mentor's suggestions, if needed.
5. Build the Rails application:
    - Set up a new Rails project using the **`rails new`** command.
    - Implement the features outlined in your approved project proposal.
    - Apply the concepts learned from the Rails documentation, online resources, and your mentor's guidance.
    - Organize your code following Rails conventions and best practices.
    - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage your project's codebase.
6. Demonstrate proficiency:
    - Schedule a meeting with your mentor to showcase your completed Rails application.
    - Explain the concepts you have implemented and how they relate to the Rails framework.
    - Discuss any challenges faced during the development process and how you overcame them.
    - Be prepared to answer questions about your code structure, design choices, and the overall functionality of the application.

**Note**: Throughout the learning process, document your progress, including notes, code snippets, and any challenges you encountered. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for future reference and knowledge sharing within the company.
